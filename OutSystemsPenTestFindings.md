# OutSystems Penetration Test Findings

## Introduction

When a Pen-test or penetration test is performed some finding are false positives for the OutSystems platform.

See the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for the top ten vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.

OutSystems Security pages:

> OutSystems dramatically accelerates application development. This speed cannot be at the expense of security. OutSystems provides a secure runtime environment and the tools necessary for secure development.

## Findings

Next follows a list of findings and the response on how to mitigate the problem or an explanation why this finding is not applicable.

### Cookie without **HttpOnly** flag

A web application can use cookies to keep track of users and their sessions. A cookie can be created with different flags. The **HttpOnly** flag is not be set by the web application when sending a new cookie to the user.

**False Positive**
OutSystems states the following at: [Authentication Cookies](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Secure_the_Applications/Configure_App_Authentication#Authentication_Cookies)

When the end user logs in, the server sends two authentication cookies to the app. These cookies let the end user to be authenticated in the subsequent server requests. This section describes the two cookies used in the authentication mechanism of an OutSystems app.

Cookie nr1 `<User Provider Name>` :

* The server uses the cookie to enforce session expiration as needed.
* Contains information needed to ensure session authenticity.
* Its **HttpOnly** flag is set to true and the cookie can't be accessed through JavaScript.

Cookie nr2 `<User Provider Name>` :

* Provides information to the application code about the user identifier via the built-in function **GetUserId**.
* Contains information needed to avoid Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
* Its **HttpOnly** flag is set to **false** and the cookie can be accessed through JavaScript. **Don't change the HttpOnly flag of the nr2 cookie to true, as that can cause unexpected behavior of the apps.**
