## introduction

## what darktable is

* A RAW Development processor
* An image library management tool

Darktable  is very similar to Adobe Lightroom it is designed as a **raw development engine**. That doesn't mean you can't process jpegs of course you can but it's designed for working with raw files and it is also a
**library management tool** so it allows you to do **color ratings**, **star ratings** add **keywords** all that sort of stuff as well as give you **very advanced search**, **filtering** and **sorting tools** as well.

## what darktable is not

* Multi-layer compositing environment
* A descructive image editor

It is not a multi-layer or compositing program so don't think of it like Photoshop.
