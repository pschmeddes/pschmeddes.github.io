# Transforming acceptance criteria into Gherkin

Step by step guide:

1. Identify the key acceptance criteria: Look at the acceptance criteria and identify the key features that need to be tested.

1. Write a descriptive title: Start by writing a descriptive title that summarizes the scenario being tested. This title should be concise and clear.

1. Write the Given step: The Given step describes the initial state of the scenario. It should provide all the necessary context for the test. Start the step with the keyword 'Given', followed by a description of the initial state.

1. Write the When step: The When step describes the action that triggers the scenario. Start the step with the keyword 'When', followed by a description of the action.

1. Write the Then step: The Then step describes the expected outcome of the scenario. Start the step with the keyword 'Then', followed by a description of the expected outcome.

1. Write Examples: Examples are used to illustrate different variations of the scenario. Each example consists of a table with columns for the input data and the expected output. Start the example with the keyword 'Examples', followed by the table.

1. Use variables: Use variables to make the scenarios more flexible and reusable. Variables are denoted by angle brackets '<>' and can be replaced with specific values in the example table.

1. Review and refine: Review the Gherkin scenario and refine as necessary. Make sure it is clear, concise, and covers all the key acceptance criteria.

Here is an example of Gherkin scenario based on acceptance criteria:

```gherkin
Scenario: Search for a product
  Given the user is on the homepage
  When the user enters "headphones" in the search bar and clicks the search button
  Then the user should see a list of headphones matching the search criteria

Examples:
  | Search term | Expected results |
  | headphones | 10 matching products |
  | earphones  | 5 matching products  |
```

In this example, the acceptance criteria is to test the search functionality of a website. The Gherkin scenario consists of a title, Given, When, Then steps, and examples to test different search terms and expected results.
