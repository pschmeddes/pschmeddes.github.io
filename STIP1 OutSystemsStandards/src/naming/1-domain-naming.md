# Domain naming

The following rules apply to naming domains:

* Domain names are written in **plain English** (There are no specific OutSystems naming restrictions).
* Max length of domain names is **50 characters**.
* Vertical domains have a **meaningful business name** (e.g. `Soccer Fields`, `Movies`)
* Horizontal domains have a meaningful name, which may be more technical (e.g. `Identity`, `Back-end Style Guide`)
* Define an acronym for each domain. e.g. Soccer Fields :`SF`
