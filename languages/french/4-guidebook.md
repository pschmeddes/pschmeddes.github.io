### Ma famille !

In English we say **my mother** and **my father**. In French you'd say **mon père** and **ma mère**, because words like **my** and **your** change based on the gender of the word after them!

| masculine |  -  | feminine |  -  |
| --------- | -- | -------- | -- |
| mon père | my father | ma mère | my mother |
| ton frère | your brother | ta sœur | your sister |
| son fils | his / her son | sa fille | his / her daughter |

mon père - my father

### Whose kid is this?

In English, we say **Marie_'s_ cat**. But in French, you'd switch the word order and say **le chat _de_ Marie**.

le chat de Marie - Marie's cat

Before vowels **de** becomes **d'**.

le chien d'Anna - Anna's dog
