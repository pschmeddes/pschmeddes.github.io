# Architectural Decision Records

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An [Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture and quality. An ***Architectural Decision Record (ADR)*** captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).

Note: The term “architecture decision record” can be used interchangeably.
