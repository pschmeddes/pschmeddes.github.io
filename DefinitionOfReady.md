# Definition of Ready

A Story is ready for sprint when:
- The story has a self-explanatory title in the format: "As a <role>, I want <function> so that <business goal>"

    - User stories must (ideally) be **Independent** from one anotherâ€™s
    - User stories must be **Negotiable** in conversations between the business and the development team
    - User stories must be acknowledged by the business that their are **Valuable**
    - User stories must be written to be **Estimable**
    - User stories should be as **Small** as possible
    - User stories must be **Testable** through Acceptance Criteria

    - business rules that apply
    -	the business objects used
    -	mock-up screens and story boards when applicable
-	Acceptance criteria describe all features of the story. The story is complete once the acceptance criteria have been met. Acceptance criteria are described as scenarios using the [**Given-When-Then**](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/gwt) format [^1]
-	The story can be completed in one sprint.
-	No external dependencies prevent the story from being completed.
-	The story points have been assigned by the team.
