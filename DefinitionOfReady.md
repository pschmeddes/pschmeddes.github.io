# Definition of Ready

A Story is ready for sprint when:
*	The story complies with the Quality User Story Framework:

**Well-formed, Full sentence, Uniform**
: The story has a self-explanatory title in the format: "As a <role>, I want <function> so that <business goal>"

**Atomic**
: A user story expresses a requirement for exactly one feature

**Minimal**
: A user story contains nothing more than role, action and benefit.

**Conceptually sound**
: The action expresses a feature and the benefit expresses a rationale.

**Problem-oriented**
: A user story only specifies the problem, not the solution to it

**Unambiguous**
: A user story avoids terms or abstractions that lead to multiple interpretations.
**Estimable**
: A story does not denote an unrefined requirement that is hard to plan and prioritize

Has a clear description including references to:
*	the process description
*	the use case scenario
*	business rules that apply
*	the business objects used
*	mock-up screens and story boards when applicable
*	acceptance criteria describe all features of the story. The story is complete once the acceptance criteria have been met
* acceptance criteria are described as scenarios using the [Gherkin](https://www.guru99.com/gherkin-test-cucumber.html) language [^1]
*	The story can be completed in one sprint.
*	No external dependencies prevent the story from being completed.
*	The story points have been assigned by the team.
*	The story has been prioritized.

[^1]: We require Gherkin to enable the BDD Testframework. See [Your Complete Guide To BDD Testing In OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/bdd-testing/) see this [Using the Gherkin Language to Write User Stories](https://youtu.be/KP0vpVLatMc) tutorial how to use it.
