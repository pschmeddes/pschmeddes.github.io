# Service Action naming conventions

Service actions are also known as **O**utSystems **API**s (OAPI)

1. Service Actions follow the Server Action naming with the suffix "SA"
1. Versioning
    * Only use major versions, starting at **_v1**.
    * Versions are reflected in the name of the Service Action.
    * Only backwards INcompatible updates lead to a new version of the API.
1. Don't use underscores in names

Example: **CustomerCreateSAv1**
