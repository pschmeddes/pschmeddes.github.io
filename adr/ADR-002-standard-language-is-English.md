# ADR 2: Standard language is English

## Context

When developing code most developers tend to use their native language (Dutch) which is easier than using English for most of us. This will create issues when there is the need to share this documentation with someone who does not speak your language. Such a s support engineer or a developer from another country.

## Decision

We will use English as the standard language for all project documentation, code and comments.

## Rationale

Making English the standard language contributes to the maintainability of the applications

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

* When all system documentation is in English all English speaking parties have access to the documentation.
* A drawback is that it is much easier to express yourself in your native language.
